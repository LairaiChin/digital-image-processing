# digital-image-processing
A win form applicatoin with the ability to process bitmaps implemented in VS2010. 
It has the ability to perform basic manipulations like grey stretch, edge detection, Fourrier transform and hitogram transform etc. on any single bitmap.
All algorithms are roughly implemented, so it's just an primary reference for beginners. :-P
